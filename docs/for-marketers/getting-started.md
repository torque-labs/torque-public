# Getting Started

Torque out of the box supports integrations with Telegram & Twitter (X).&#x20;

In this document we will go through how to get started with using the Torque Platform, once you have an approved wallet address.&#x20;

## Create A Project

**Project Details**

The first thing you will do on Torque is create a project. In order to properly get setup you will need to enter the project name, X account, project logo, and connect your Telegram (if you are interested in using this).&#x20;

**Distribution Channels**

Next, you will need to setup your distribution channels. This will require you proving authentication through your Telegram oAuth account.&#x20;

Next if you're interested in using the Telegram Bot to send incentivized actions to your channel and track your telegram channel's engagement and growth you will need to add the Torque Bot.

To add the Torque Bot you will need to do the following:

1. DM the Torque Bot: @TORQRobot  (this is required by the Telegram TOS).
2. Add the bot to your channel and provide it admin privileges
3. The bot will message you asking how many members are in your group, answer it, and it will provide you a code.&#x20;
4. Click the checkmark for "I have added Torque bot to my group", and enter in the code you received from the bot. Then click "authenticate.
5. Click "Create Project"

That's it you're all done! You can now push incentivized actions to the Telegram bot on demand and track your telegram community.&#x20;
