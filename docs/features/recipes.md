# Recipes

Torque has put together Recipes that you can use on a daily or weekly basis for driving engagement and growth towards your project.&#x20;

To access this feature, click on left-hand nav menu for "Recipes". There you can select what your objective is, and the config required for the recipe.&#x20;

For example let's do a "follow" campaign. In this example I will reward my userbase for following my twitter profile.
