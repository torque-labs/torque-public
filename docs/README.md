# Welcome to Torque

## Introduction

**Torque is a growth protocol which allows any user to launch incentivized actions.**&#x20;

**Actions** are made up of three parameters:

* **Audience** - Defines who can or cannot execute the action, based on public keys.
* **Incentives** - Rewards such as tokens, NFTs, or points.
* **Terms** - The conditions that must be met for incentive distribution.

When an action is launched, the incentives are [escrowed into a PDA](https://solana.com/docs/core/pda) and the distribution terms are set. Once these terms are met, the incentives are automatically cranked and distributed to eligible users.

## Why Use Torque?

Torque's company objective is to help builders find product market fit. We believe the best way to accomplish this is through analytics, experimentation, and token distribution to the right users.&#x20;

**Maximum Flexibility**

Torque is designed for maximum flexibility. By collaborating with top teams in Solana, we’ve identified key growth challenges and recognized that no campaign or strategy is exactly the same. In doing so, we've seen common patterns emerge across successful teams:

* Growth works best when it’s deeply integrated into a project’s strategy, rather than added as an afterthought.
* Teams inevitably build similar token distribution mechanics to drive sustainable engagement.
* Builders should focus engineering resources on their product—not on manually managing token distribution and marketing campaigns.

**All-in-One Marketing Platform**

The Torque Platform is designed from the ground up to empower both non-technical users and developers. Easily connect on-chain actions via IDL or integrate web-based events directly with on-chain rewards. The platform and SDK seamlessly integrate with Telegram, web apps, and Discord (coming soon).

Much like Zapier, Torque enables builders to quickly set up custom triggers and actions that directly link token distribution to product usage—allowing teams to easily monitor and accelerate growth without requiring heavy engineering resources. This gives your team the ability to tweak token distribution to meet your goals.

**A Clear Objective**

Torque handles growth infrastructure so your team can focus on your product. Instead of juggling multiple tools to chase vanity metrics, Torque provides an all-in-one platform that simplifies the complexity of incentivizing growth. Key features include:

• Community Milestones: Automatically distribute tokens when users collectively achieve defined goals.

• Collaborative Vaults: Allow other teams to enhance your incentives by adding their own rewards, enabling collaborative growth strategies.

• Social Integration: Effortlessly push actions directly to Discord and Telegram communities, with built-in usage monitoring.

• Leaderboards: Showcase community engagement through customizable leaderboards tied directly to incentivized actions.
