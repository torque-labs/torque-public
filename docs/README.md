# Introduction

### **Ship on‑chain incentives in minutes—not months.**&#x20;

Connect real user activity to rewards (tokens, NFTs, points) with pre‑indexed Solana data, precision targeting, and built‑in analytics & optimization.

### **Why use Torque?**

1. **Plug and play, skip indexing.** Torque already tracks activity across top Solana programs; add your IDL in seconds and you’re incentive‑ready.&#x20;
2. **Launch & automate fast.** Spin up leaderboards, rebates, raffles, airdrops, and instant rewards via drag‑and‑drop or code—then auto‑issue tokens, NFTs, or points on real behavior.
3. **Prove ROI with precision audiences.** Segment high‑value users, add anti‑wash filters and lookbacks, then measure, learn, and optimize every campaign.&#x20;

### **Who this is for?**

* **Marketing Teams** who want to drive growth tied to real onchain usage.
* **Developers** who need reliable primitives to connect onchain usage to rewards (and optionally off‑chain rewards via webhook).

### **What you can build in the next 5 minutes:**

* Weekly trading leaderboards with a fixed prize pool.
* Net‑new depositor rebates with wash‑trade filtering and caps.
* Participation raffles with minimum activity thresholds.
* Action‑gated incentives to provide bonus rewards in real-time
