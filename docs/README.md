# Introduction to Torque

## Incentivize Any User for Any Action



**Torque Protocol allows anyone to launch an onchain offer to incentivize any on / offchain action or series of actions**.&#x20;

When an offer is launched, the rewards for offer completion are escrowed into a PDA and the conditions for reward distribution are set. Once the conditions have been validated, the reward will automatically be distributed to users satisfying the condition of the reward.&#x20;

## Why Use Torque?

### For Builders

* Use onchain assets to drive growth for your protocol
* Control different factors such as duration, reward types & amounts, actions, and audiences

### For Publishers (Wallets / Apps)

* Share offers to users and receive rewards when users complete the offers
* Generate passive revenue when users complete high value actions
