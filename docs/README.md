# Welcome to Torque

## Introduction

**Torque is a growth protocol which allows any user to launch incentivized actions.**&#x20;

**Actions** are made up of three parameters:

* **Audience** - who's allowed/denied to execute this action, defined by publicKey
* **Incentives** - tokens, NFT's or points stored in a PDA
* **Terms** - the conditions required in order to distribute the incentives

When an action is launched, the incentives are [escrowed into a PDA](https://solana.com/docs/core/pda) and the terms for reward distribution are set.&#x20;

Once the terms have been met, the incentives will be automatically cranked, enabling their distribution to users who have satisfied the required conditions.&#x20;

Torque has been designed to maximize flexibility. By working with the top teams in Solana, we understood the painpoints faced around growth and how no campaign or strategy is exactly the same.&#x20;

In addition, we understood that:

1. Growth needs to be integrated deeply into your strategy rather than bolted on
2. All successful teams end up building similar token distribution mechanics
3. Builders have enough to worry about and should spend their time on the product versus token distribution & marketing campaigns
