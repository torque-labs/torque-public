# Welcome to Torque

## Introduction

Torque is a growth protocol that allows teams to effortlessly launch incentivized actions, linking any user behavior directly to rewards like tokens, NFTs, or points.

Each action has three simple components:

* Audience: Who can participate, defined by public keys or user segments.
* Incentives: The reward type users will receive.
* Terms: Specific conditions users must meet to earn these rewards.

## Why Use Torque

Much like Zapier automates workflows between apps, Torque ties token distribution to user actionsâ€”saving valuable time and resources while enabling targeted growth.

ðŸ›  **For Developers**

Torque makes it easy to integrate on-chain and off-chain actions into your product and automate reward distribution.

* Add your onchain actions (via IDL), protocol actions, or offchain events&#x20;
* Launch incentives that trigger rewards tied to actions when conditions are met.
* Track & Optimize performance in real time, tweaking incentives instantly.
