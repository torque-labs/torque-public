# How it Works

## 1. Define an Action

Select the user behavior you want to incentivize, such as token purchases, NFT minting, liquidity deposits, or social engagements.

Each action consists of:

* Audience: Who can participate (e.g., wallet allowlists, public users, or specific segments).
* Terms: Conditions users must meet (e.g., purchase minimum tokens, stake for set durations, or complete specific tasks).

## 2. Set Incentives

Choose how users are rewarded upon meeting action terms:

* Direct Incentives: Immediate rewards (tokens, NFTs, or points).
* Asymmetric Incentives: Rewards based on chance, such as raffle entries.

## 3. Automate Distribution

Torque fully automates incentive distribution based on rules you set:

* Distribution Rules: Conditions such as minimum conversions, timing, or event-based triggers.
* Dynamic Allocation: Formulas to adjust incentives based on user participation levels, timing, or order.

Once configured, Torque manages distribution seamlessly, requiring minimal ongoing intervention.

## 4. Track and Optimize

Monitor real-time performance and adjust incentives instantly:

* Adjust reward amounts or conditions mid-campaign.
* Add new incentives dynamically to enhance engagement.
* Refine campaigns continuously using real-time data.

## 5. Easy Integration

Developers can integrate Torque with minimal engineering overhead:

* On-Chain Integration: Use existing onchain programs OR upload your own.
* Off-Chain Integration: APIs, webhooks, or external triggers.
* SDK & APIs: Quickly build and manage incentive campaigns directly within your product.

Torque simplifies the end-to-end process of creating and optimizing token-based incentives, enabling your team to focus on driving growth.
