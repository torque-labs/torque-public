# How it Works

## 1. Plan Your Campaign

Come up with answers to the following:

1. What is the budget?
2. Is it Recurring or a One-off?
3. What are your key success metrics?
4. What variables do you want to control and optimize towards?

## 2. Define an Incentive

Torque makes going from 0 to launch, easy.&#x20;

How to launch either a **Precision** or **Real-Time Incentive.**

**Precision**

1. Define your [audience](../core-concepts/audiences.md) and query
   1. Build a Live Leaderboard to show the onchain activity and drive engagement further
2. Setup the [incentive](../core-concepts/incentives.md) (Leaderboard, Raffle, Rebate, Airdrop)
3. Fund [Distributor](../core-concepts/distributors.md) and Launch using Torque's Platform.

**Real-Time**

1. Create an [incentive](../core-concepts/incentives.md) with our drag-and-drop tool or SDK
2. Setup the [distribution](../core-concepts/distributors.md) conditions
3. Fund and launch using Torque Platform or SDK.

## 3. Track and Optimize

Monitor real-time performance and adjust incentives instantly:

* Adjust reward amounts or conditions mid-campaign.
* Add new incentives dynamically to enhance engagement.
* Refine campaigns continuously using real-time data.

## Bonus: Integrate into your product

Developers can integrate Torque with minimal engineering overhead:

* On-Chain Integration: Use existing onchain programs OR add your own.
* Off-Chain Integration: APIs, webhooks, or external triggers.
* SDK & APIs: Quickly build launch and manage incentive campaigns directly within your product.

Torque simplifies the end-to-end process of creating and optimizing token-based incentives, enabling your team to focus on driving growth.
